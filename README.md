# 🚗 Vehicle Classification MLOps Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** for a Machine Learning application, from data ingestion to deployment with CI/CD using GitHub Actions and AWS infrastructure.

> 💡 **Tech Stack:** Python, MongoDB, AWS (S3, EC2, IAM, ECR), Docker, GitHub Actions, FastAPI/Flask, Conda

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

* ✅ Modular Code Structure with Configs, Entities & Component-based Design
* ✅ MongoDB Atlas Integration for Data Storage
* ✅ Logging & Exception Handling Framework
* ✅ Data Ingestion → Validation → Transformation → Model Training → Evaluation
* ✅ Model Registry & Versioning with AWS S3
* ✅ Scalable Deployment with Docker + EC2 + GitHub CI/CD Pipelines
* ✅ Real-time Inference via Web App

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n vehicle python=3.10 -y
conda activate vehicle
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2. MongoDB Integration

* Setup MongoDB Atlas with open access (`0.0.0.0/0`)
* Store credentials securely as environment variables:

```bash
export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net"
```

* Push dataset via Jupyter Notebook (`mongoDB_demo.ipynb`) and verify in MongoDB Atlas UI.

---

### 3. Pipeline Components

#### ✅ Data Ingestion

* Connect to MongoDB
* Pull raw documents and convert to DataFrame
* Save raw data as artifacts

#### ✅ Data Validation

* YAML schema-based validation
* Null checks, type validation, schema enforcement

#### ✅ Data Transformation

* Feature engineering and transformation
* Estimator creation and preprocessing

#### ✅ Model Training

* Training ML model with tracking of metrics
* Serialization of the best model artifact

#### ✅ Model Evaluation + AWS Integration

* Compare with previously pushed model on S3
* Evaluate score difference
* Push new model to S3 if improved

---

## ☁️ Cloud Integration

### 🔐 AWS Setup

* IAM User with `AdministratorAccess`
* Configure keys in `constants/__init__.py`
* Setup `.aws/credentials` and `src/configuration/aws_connection.py`

### 📦 S3 Bucket

* Store trained models under:

```
Bucket: my-model-mlopsproj
Path: s3://my-model-mlopsproj/model-registry
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment & CI/CD

### 🔧 Docker + EC2 + GitHub Actions

* Create **Dockerfile** & `.github/workflows/aws.yaml`
* Use **GitHub Secrets** for secure deployment
* Setup **AWS ECR** for container storage
* Launch **EC2 Ubuntu Server** with Docker and GitHub Runner

### ✅ CI/CD Workflow

* Triggered on every push to `main`
* Build → Push Docker image → Pull on EC2 → Start container

---

## 🌐 Web App

* FastAPI/Flask App at `app.py`
* Routes:

  * `/` → Home
  * `/predict` → Prediction
  * `/train` → Trigger Training Pipeline

Once deployed:

```http
http://<EC2-PUBLIC-IP>:5080
```

---

## 📊 Notebooks

* `EDA & Feature Engineering`
* `MongoDB Demo`

---

## 📌 CI/CD Setup Summary

* ✅ GitHub → GitHub Actions
* ✅ Docker → Build image
* ✅ AWS ECR → Push image
* ✅ EC2 Ubuntu → Pull + Run app container
* ✅ GitHub Secrets → Secure AWS credentials

---

## 🎯 Key Skills Demonstrated

* ✅ Full-stack MLOps Implementation
* ✅ Scalable & Modular Codebase
* ✅ Real-world Cloud & DevOps Practices
* ✅ Reproducible ML Workflow
* ✅ GitHub CI/CD with Self-Hosted Runners
